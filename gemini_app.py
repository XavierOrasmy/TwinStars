                    You are an expert educational analyst. Based on the following student work and list of topics, please perform a detailed three-part analysis.

                    **Part 1: Analyze Existing Weaknesses**
                    Analyze the provided student work to identify every area of underperformance. Then, present a ranked list of these topics from weakest to strongest.

                    **Part 2: Predict Future Challenges**
                    Using the ranked weakness profile from Part 1 and the full list of target topics, predict which upcoming subjects the student is most likely to struggle with. Provide a prioritized list of these future trouble spots.

                    **Part 3: Generate a Tailored Study Plan**
                    Generate a concise and actionable study plan to address both the current weak areas and the predicted challenges. For each topic in the study plan, you must include:
                    1.  **Key Concepts to Review:** A bulleted list of the most important concepts for that topic.
                    2.  **Recommended Practice Exercises:** Suggestions for types of problems or questions to practice.
                    3.  **Resource Links or Summaries:** Provide a relevant, high-quality resource link (like a Khan Academy or university page) or a brief summary of the topic if a link is not available.

                    Please structure your entire output clearly with the following markdown headings:
                    ### 1. Ranked List of Existing Weaknesses
                    ### 2. Forecast of Future Trouble Spots
