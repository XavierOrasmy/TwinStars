Problem 1: Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 15
Solution:
2x = 15 - 5
2x = 10
x = 5
Instructor's Note: Correct.

Problem 2: Solve for y in 3(y - 2) = 9
Solution:
3y - 6 = 9
3y = 15
y = 5
Instructor's Note: Correct. Great job distributing the 3.

Problem 3: If 4a + 7 = 23, what is the value of a?
Solution:
4a = 23 - 7
4a = 16
a = 4
Instructor's Note: Excellent.
