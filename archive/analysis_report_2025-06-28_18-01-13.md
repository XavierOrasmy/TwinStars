### 1. Ranked List of Existing Weaknesses

1. **Translating Word Problems into Equations:** Alex consistently struggles to set up equations correctly from word problems, showing a fundamental misunderstanding of how to represent real-world scenarios mathematically. This is evident in the train problem and the garden problem.

2. **Factoring Quadratic Equations:** While Alex can sometimes factor correctly (Problem 2 in the Homework assignment), his inconsistent performance (Midterm Exam, Problem 1) shows a lack of mastery in this area.  He also makes sign errors in solving factored quadratics.

3. **Solving Quadratic Equations (by factoring):**  This is closely related to factoring. Alex correctly factors in some instances, but makes mistakes in solving for the roots once factored, revealing a gap in understanding of the zero-product property.

4. **Solving Linear Equations:** Alex demonstrates proficiency in solving basic linear equations but this foundational strength has not translated into success with the more complex linear equations in word problems.

### 2. Forecast of Future Trouble Spots

1. **Systems of Linear Equations:**  Given Alex's weakness in translating word problems and setting up equations, this topic, which often involves multiple equations representing different aspects of a single problem, will likely prove challenging.

2. **Polynomial Functions:**  Building upon the demonstrated weaknesses in factoring and solving quadratic equations, Alex will struggle with higher-order polynomial functions, especially factoring and finding roots.

3. **Understanding Functions and Relations:** While not directly related to the weaknesses shown, a strong understanding of functions and relations is crucial for success in subsequent mathematical topics, including polynomials and logarithmic functions. Alex's weaknesses suggest he may not have a solid foundation here.

4. **Graphing Linear Equations:**  Though not directly tested, success in graphing linear equations requires a strong understanding of solving linear equations which, while shown as a relative strength, didn't transfer to word problems.  This could be an area of unforeseen difficulty.

**1. Translating Word Problems into Equations**

*   **Key Concepts to Review:**  Defining variables, identifying key information, translating phrases into mathematical expressions (e.g., "more than," "less than," "times," etc.), setting up equations that represent the relationships described in the problem.

*   **Recommended Practice Exercises:**  Solve a variety of word problems involving different scenarios (distance-rate-time, geometry, mixture problems, etc.). Start with simpler problems and gradually increase complexity.

*   **Specific Study Questions:**
    *   A car travels at 50 mph for 2 hours, then at 60 mph for 3 hours.  What is the total distance traveled?
    *   Two numbers add up to 30, and one is 8 more than the other. What are the numbers?
    *   A rectangle's length is 3 cm more than its width. If its perimeter is 22 cm, find its dimensions.
