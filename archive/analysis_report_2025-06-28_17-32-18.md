### 1. Ranked List of Existing Weaknesses

Alex's performance reveals a clear hierarchy of weaknesses:

1. **Translating Word Problems into Equations:** Alex consistently struggles to set up equations from word problems, demonstrating a fundamental gap in translating real-world scenarios into mathematical representations.  This is evident across multiple assignments (Train problem, Garden problem).

2. **Factoring Quadratic Equations:** Alex displays significant difficulty factoring quadratic expressions, making mistakes in both the process and sign manipulation (Problem 1 & 2 of the Quadratics Midterm).

3. **Solving Quadratic Equations (by factoring):** While Alex can apply the quadratic formula correctly, his weakness in factoring directly impacts his ability to solve quadratic equations through this method. He makes sign errors after correctly factoring (Quadratics Midterm, Problem 2).

4. **Solving Linear Equations:** While Alex demonstrates competency in solving basic linear equations, his performance here is the least problematic compared to other areas.


### 2. Forecast of Future Trouble Spots

Based on Alex's existing weaknesses and the list of target topics, the following are predicted future trouble spots, prioritized from most to least likely:

1. **Systems of Linear Equations:**  This topic builds directly upon translating word problems and solving linear equations.  Since Alex struggles with both, combining these skills will likely prove challenging.

2. **Polynomial Functions:**  This topic involves manipulating and solving polynomial expressions which is directly related to Alex's weakness in factoring quadratics.  Higher-order polynomial factoring will present amplified difficulties.

3. **Understanding Functions and Relations:** Although not directly linked to Alex's immediate weaknesses, a strong foundation in translating word problems and solving equations is crucial for understanding functions.  Weakness in these areas could hinder his grasp of functional relationships.

4. **Graphing Linear Equations:** Although seemingly distinct, the ability to translate word problems into equations is vital for correctly interpreting and graphing real-world scenarios.

5. **Logarithmic Functions and Matrix Algebra:** These topics are less directly connected to Alex's current weaknesses and are typically introduced later in the curriculum.  While potential challenges exist, they are lower on the priority list.
